        <p class="sample-text" style="text-align: justify;">
          It is a fact that today the culture of games is already very widespread in our culture and almost everyone play some kind of game on a platform, be it a console or computer, but mainly on smartphones. Due to its portability, it is very common to find people playing on their smartphones. It is practical and accessible.
          <br><br>
          The games are increasingly immersive, either by the graphics, mechanics or the stories and narratives they have. For this reason, some technologies are becoming very popular in recent times. It provides new ways to interact with games, providing a greater immersion. Augmented reality has started to stand out in the smartphone gaming world. It offers a vast new range of possibilities for digital gaming to interact with the physical environments.
          <br><br>
          Augmented reality gaming (AR gaming) is the integration of game visual and audio content with the user's environment in real time to entertain, motivate, educate, and inspire the user. Augmented reality games, while not limited to mobile devices, are typically played on devices like smartphones, tablets and portable gaming systems. While playing the game, the player aims the device's camera at a location and through the device's screen, sees the area captured by the camera plus computer-generated graphics atop it, augmenting the display and then allowing the player to interact that way. AR gaming provides a uniquely immersive experience.
          <br><br>
          Immersion is only one way for players to enjoy a game. The experience of playing games can be characterize in four aspects: physical, mental, social, and emotional. AR games could be physical to the same extent as real-world games, with the added advantage that game content can be injected seamlessly into the real world. The mental aspect of a game concerns problem solving, deductive thought and reason. AR will be able to present game information in a spatial context, which may allow players to reason about it better. The social aspect of a game is the way in which players play with each other. It contains elements of collaboration, negotiation and relationship building. Thus, participants in AR games should be able to interact with each other in natural face to face communication. The emotional aspect of games is perhaps the most difficult to understand. It concerns the way a game affects a player emotionally, by the sympathies they develop with game characters or players and the emotions brought forth by immersion in the game world [3].
          <br><br>
          <h3 class="mb-30">Games</h3>
          “Pokémon Go”, released by Niantic in July 2016, quickly became a top mobile game and was downloaded more than 500 million times in its first year. The game by itself already presented something very flashy to the young audience caused by its nostalgic appeal because of the cartoon series and old video games. But besides that, the game brought something that was still uncommon. The use of augmented reality in its interaction. It is considered the breakthrough AR app for gaming. The game also created a lot of criticism and raised even more questions about how we interact with the world around us, what this technology can still provide in the future.
          <br><br>
          Currently, we can see several AR games that are as attractive, fun and immersive as you can imagine. One example is the "AR Dragon" game, a "pet simulator" that allows you to create your own pet dragon. Reviews of the game states that the dragon is able to interact with the player and the physical scenery quite accurately and realistically, as if he really were there.

          <h3 class="text-heading">Guidelines</h3>
          Even though AR gaming is becoming mainstream, the adoption and use of this tech depends on how good the user interaction is. There are design principles to help designers enhance usability. These principles are sets of generally applicable laws, human biases and design considerations reflecting the accumulated knowledge and experience of practitioners and researchers. The principles aim to help designers to enhance the system usability, influence perception, improve the system appeal, teach users and help decision making during the development. A careful selection and application of appropriate principles should increase the probability of a successful user interaction. Also, the manner the designer applies each principle depends on his/her ability to rationalize, understand, and contextualize all the aspect of the system his/her is designing.
          <br><br>
          One of the most known design principles is Jakob Nielsen's heuristics. Nielsen developed the heuristics in 1994 and they are the most-used usability heuristics for user interface design. They are as follows:[2].
          <br><br>
          <h4>Nielsen's heuristics</h4>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <ol class="ordered-list list-divided" style="counter-reset: item 0; text-align: justify;">
                <li><span><b>Visibility of system status:</b></span></li>
                <span>The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.</span>
                <li><span><b>Match between system and the real world:</b></span></li>
                <span>The system should speak the user's language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.</span>
                <li><span><b>User control and freedom:</b></span></li>
                <span>Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.</span>
                <li><span><b>Consistency and standards:</b></span></li>
                <span>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.</span>
                <li><span><b>Error prevention:</b></span></li>
                <span>Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.</span>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <ol class="ordered-list list-divided" style="counter-reset: item 5; text-align: justify;">
                <li><span><b>Recognition rather than recall:</b></span></li>
                <span>Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.</span>
                <li><span><b>Flexibility and efficiency of use:</b></span></li>
                <span>Accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.</span>
                <li><span><b>Aesthetic and minimalist design:</b></span></li>
                <span>Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.</span>
                <li><span><b>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:</b></span></li>
                <span>Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.</span>
                <li><span><b>Help and documentation:</b></span></li>
                <span>Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.</span>

          However, this page is focusing on specific guidelines on how to design a good AR gaming experience. The guidelines shown in the next section are the only papers found on the research community about the subject.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="typo-list" style="text-align: center">What do we know about how to design good AR experiences as they relate to games?</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="sample-text" style="text-align: justify;">
          The growing popularity of AR games has led for a need to take a closer look at design related issues that impact on player experience. While most of the issues are technology, it is almost always assumed that the augmented reality element in itself will provide a sufficient experience for the player. This creates a need to analyze what makes a successful augmented reality game.
          <br><br>          
          There are a few research papers that set guidelines for designing AR games. Wetzel et al present a set of design guidelines which are drawn from experiences of three mixed reality games. Xu et al analyze and generate design lessons from dozens of HAR (Handheld AR) games. Xu ate al summarize their results as “pre-patterns” derived from existing practices into repeatable principles and solutions. 
          <br><br>
          Wetzel et al present a set of high level design guidelines which are drawn from three mixed reality games. The guidelines provide specific guidance on relationships between real and virtual space, social interaction, use of AR technologies. Table 1 summarises the different range of characteristics, technologies and interaction techniques from the three games (Interference, Timewrap and The eye of Judgment) [5].

          <h4>Pre-Patterns</h4>
          <p class="sample-text" style="text-align: justify;">
            Xu et al analyze and generate design lessons from dozens of handheld AR (HAR) games. The design patterns are drawn from academic and commercial AR games, and also from their years of experience designing and teaching HAR game design. They summarize into a set of design “pre-patterns” as a means of formalizing significant design lessons derived from these existing practices into repeatable principles and solutions. Table 3 illustrates the nine design pre-patterns. They briefly summarize a few small design lessons into a list of dos and don’ts [6].

            The pre-patterns leverage skills of the players, and can be used to inform the design of gameplay experiences that take advantage of embodied interaction enabled by HAR interface. They provide a solid foundation for thinking about designing fun and compelling HAR games.

          <h3 class="text-heading">Conclusion</h3>
          <p class="sample-text" style="text-align: justify;">
            Augmented Reality is a technology that has existed in concept for long time. The last few years has seen the field change radically as the technology has become more available to consumers, and companies has started to put more resources in to developing commercial AR products. There are a lot of possibilities to explore with augmented reality. Augmented reality games enables a more engaging experience.
            <br><br>
            The guidelines presented aim to solve some of the many challenges associated with user experience design of augmented reality applications. Dirin et al. list challenges faced by mobile augmented reality applications. One of the challenges is the physical aspect. Often, almost the whole body needs to be involved while interacting with AR application. Users need to interact and communicate with the application by clicking, tapping, moving, gesturing or giving voice commands. Other challenge is the development of the user interface. Designers have already managed to construct user interface and interaction metaphors for non-AR applications. All mobile application design metaphors are not necessarily applicable to mobile augmented reality applications; hence, new interface and interaction metaphors specific for mobile augmented reality applications are needed. Another challenge is the user experience design. Designers are required to adjust their design approaches, which are based on 2D sketching of non-AR objects using a pen and paper or mock-up tools, towards sketching of 3D scenes and objects that are viewed through a 2D perspective [1].
            <br><br>
            When designing for interactions with device through physical media, it is important to design for intuitive user control. A common solution in creating intuitive interactions is to use metaphors. Metaphors help the user understand the digital worlds actions by relating it to the actions of the physical world, and this has been used during many years in making digital design more understandable. When designing for interactions with the device through digital media, the problem is mainly tracking and registration. The problem for geo-location based AR is accuracy and constant connectivity. These limitations are hard to design around, but they need to considered. When considering the user experience, the user can lose focus or get lost in the augmented space if an unlimited freedom is provided. Therefore a design that helps the user in finding what they are looking for or that limits the users space should be provided. When designing for physical interactions with an object that does not physically exist in the real space, consider solutions wherein the user does not need to hold, grab or otherwise perform interactions that require a lot of the hand to interact with the object. This helps avoiding the occlusion problems. Interactions such as poking, pushing or otherwise interacting in ways where the users hand only interacts with the edge of the virtual object also helps avoid this problem [4].
            <br><br>
            There is no one golden rule to follow when designing an AR system, but it is very important to consider the context in which the user is using the system, and the purpose the user is hoping to achieve, and act accordingly to choose the guidelines and design solutions that fit best into that scenario. The presented guidelines might serve as a good starting point for anyone attempting to design AR game.
